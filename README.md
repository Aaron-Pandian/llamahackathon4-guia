## üîß How To Use
_Current codebase showcases a minimum viable product. The demonstration shows how a user can upload an official immigration form to our application, receive specific instruction to fill it out, then provide a completed form ready for signiture and print._

1. Clone Repository
2. Deploy React.JS

### Future Work 

Given our foundation, we plan to create an automated pipline for instruction documentation present on the [USCIS](https://uscis.gov/) website. Using this Llama will be able to provdide official, more detailed instruction on filling out immigration documentation. For this, we collect the Instruction PDFs alongside metadata for all forms on the website and house the structured data (as links to images  in Firebase. We are developing API calls that can search our database, retrieve relavent information, and converse with the user using PDF pages converted to images. 

To further extend application function, we will integrate prompted web search allowing the LLM to gain added context to questions that come up in conversation. This will also allow Llama to answer general questions about the immigration process, if forms are not the point of confusion for an individual.
